                    <br/>

                    <p>The eternal word left by Ibrahim (peace be upon him) is the word <b>la ilahe illallah.</b></p>
                    <br/>

                    <p>He expressed the meaning of this word with the sentence <i>"I am free from what you worship, except for the one who created me."</i></p>
                    <br/>

                    <p>In the words of Ibrahim (peace be upon him)</p>
                    <br/>
                    
                    <p style={{fontSize: "22px"}}>The statement <b>"I am free from what you worship"</b> means</p>

                    <p style={{fontSize: "22px"}}>The word <b>“La ilahe”</b></p>

                    <p style={{fontSize: "22px"}}>The expression <b>“illellezi, fetarani/except the one who created me”</b> is also</p>

                    <br/>

                    <p style={{fontSize: "22px"}}>So, the meaning of <b>“la ilahe illallah”</b> is to be free from everything that people worship except Allah, who created us.</p>
                    <br/>

                    <p style={{fontSize: "22px"}}>Abraham's statement that <b>"except the one who created me"</b> shows that one of the gods worshiped by those polytheists is Allah. In other words, polytheists are religious people who worship both Allah and others.</p>
                    <br/>

                    <p style={{fontSize: "22px"}}>Moreover, instead of saying <b>"except Allah"</b>, he says <b>"except the one who created me"</b>, in order to bind them by mentioning the fact that they accept that the Creator is Allah, as evidence against them. In other words, the polytheists believed that Allah was the only Creator, and when asked, they said so without hesitation.</p>
